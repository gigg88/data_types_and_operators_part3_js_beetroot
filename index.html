      Based on the example from the previous lesson, you can work directly in
      the browser or create separate HTML/JavaScript files â€“ choose the option
      that is more convenient for you.
    </h2>

    <h2>Text Manipulation:</h2>

    <p>
      Create a JavaScript function named formatName that takes a first name and
      last name as parameters and returns the full name in the format "Last
      Name, First Name" with proper capitalization (e.g., "Doe, John").
    </p>

    <h2>Regex Validation:</h2>

    <p>
      Write a regular expression to validate phone numbers in the following
      formats:
    </p>

    <p>XXX-XXX-XXXX</p>
    <p>(XXX) XXX-XXXX</p>
    <p>XXX XXX XXXX</p>

    <p>
      Test your regex on various phone number examples to ensure it works
      correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Array Manipulation:</h2>
    
    <p>Write a function called removeDuplicates that takes an array as input and returns a new array with all duplicate elements removed. You can use any method you like (e.g., Set, loops).</p>
